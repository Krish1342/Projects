1)Expenses Recorder
to use it first choose what you want to do:
To add a expense type "1"
then add the expense name and amount
if the expense name is already there in the device then it will add it in the same name
To see summary type "2"
To exit type "3"
Here i have used while loop to make a loop for choices 
and if else and elif for different operations
I just used the basic c++ knowledge for choices and to break the while loop I just used break command
and to give summary I used the dictionary.items to print the whole item in dictionary
